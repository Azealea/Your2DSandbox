# Your 2D Sandbox

Here is my work for the conception trial.
It is a TP on how to make 2D sandbox simulator that works in the console.

### Description

I made this practical with the focus on OOP composition & inheritance.
The focus is to understand the difference and particularities of the two systems.

In this small exercises students will be asked to implement different Cells that will be part of a Board 
where a step by step simulation will take place.

They will see in this context the inheritance by implements all types of cells from abstract classes, 
and the composition with the by adding properties to cells with interface.

### My thoughts on this Practical


The TP is quite simple in of this self, I would make it harder if I made it a second time.<br>
I would make the hard actually difficult.

Although I wanted to make sure this practical would be used to understand thoroughly the matter, 
so its not a completely a bad thing.

### Note

I did not understood how to create a TestSuite using Rider so I made my own.

Have a nice time with this work!
